## **About me**
Ever since school age, I was attracted by mathematics and other exact sciences. Then my interest moved smoothly to computer technology and programming. I started studying at the institute in this direction, where at the initial stages I showed very good results. But for family reasons, I had to change my occupation. And now, after 10 years, I still decided to make my dream come true. I hope that rsschool, a mathematical mindset, the ability to quickly assimilate information and learn to help me with this.

    function inside() {
        return firstResult + [...arguments].reduce((acc, el) => acc + el);
    }
    return inside;
}
